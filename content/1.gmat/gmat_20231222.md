question: "Maisie decides to stock rabbits at her pet store, unaware that rabbit populations double every eight months. If she starts with 6 rabbits, how many rabbits will she have in 4 years, if none of them are sold or die during this period?"

answers: [
  "96",
  "192",
  "256",
  "324",
  "384"
]

explanation: "Don't bother with complicated equations—just logic this one out. Maisie has 6 rabbits today and they double every 8 months. Calculate what happens every 8 months for the next 4 years, also known as 48 months:Today: 6 rabbits<br>8 months: 12 rabbits<br>16 months: 24 rabbits<br>24 months: 48 rabbits<br>32 months: 96 rabbits<br>40 months: 192 rabbits<br>48 months: 384 rabbitsThe calculations get a little annoying for the last two time periods. If you need a precise answer, use nearby easier numbers and then correct for your estimation. For example, 96 × 2 is really close to 100 × 2 = 200, but subtract 4 × 2 for the overcount: 200 – 8 = 192.But before you bother to calculate precise numbers, glance at the answers! In this case, they're pretty far apart, so you can go for pure estimation:<br>40 months: A little less than 100 × 2 = a little less than 200<br>48 months: A little less than 200 × 2 = a little less than 400<br>Only answer (E) is close.The correct answer is (E)."
