question: "Two circular road signs are to be painted yellow. If the radius of the larger sign is twice that of the smaller sign, how many times as much paint is needed to paint the larger sign (assuming that a given amount of paint covers the same area on both signs)?"

explanation: "The amount of paint needed to cover a circular sign is determined by the area of that sign. The formula for the area of a circle is <i>a</i> = π<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>. The problem establishes that the radius of the larger sign is 2 times the radius of the smaller sign. The question asks for the <i>relative</i> change in size from the smaller sign to the larger one—how many times larger is the larger one?Since no real numbers are stated in the problem, you can choose your own; this strategy is called Choosing Smart Numbers. Call the radius of the smaller sign 2 and the radius of the larger sign 4. <br>Area smaller = π(2)<sup>2</sup> = 4π<br>Area larger = π(4)<sup>2</sup> = 16π<br>What's the <i>relative</i> difference between these two areas? The smaller one is 4π and the larger is 16π, so the area of the larger one is 4 times the area of the smaller one. Therefore, it will take 4 times as much paint to cover the larger one.The correct answer is (C)."
