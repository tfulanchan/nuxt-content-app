explanation: "The problem states that <i>x</i> is an integer and asks for a possible value of <i>y</i> – <i>k</i>. Rearrange the equation to isolate <i>y</i> – <i>k</i> on one side.<br><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>k</i> = <i>y</i><br><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>y</i> – <i>k</i>So <i>y</i> – <i>k</i> equals <i>x</i><sup>2</sup>, and the question stem said that <i>x</i> is an integer. Since <i>x</i> is an integer, <i>x</i><sup>2</sup> has to be a perfect square. From here, look at each answer choice. If you try to take the square root and it's not going to be an integer, stop and cross that one off. Only 9 is a perfect square and returns an integer when you take the square root.The correct answer is (E)."
