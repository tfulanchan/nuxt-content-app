explanation: "The yard is a rectangle and one side is 40 feet long, so the opposite side is also 40 feet long. Call this the length. The width is unknown, but the problem also states that the area of the rectangle is 280 square feet.Find the width of the rectangle:<br>area = (length)(width)<br>280 = 40(width)<br>280 / 40 = width<br>7 = widthThe width of the yard is 7 feet and the length is 40 feet. But only three of the four sides are fenced! The three fenced sides are 40 feet, 7 feet, and 7 feet in length. The second 40-foot side is not fenced.The total length of the fencing is 40 + 7 + 7 = 54 feet.The correct answer is (C)."
