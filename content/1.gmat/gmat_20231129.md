question: "Is <i>w</i> less than <i>y</i> ?(1) 1.3 &lt; <i>w</i> &lt; 1.3101(2) 1.3033 &lt; <i>y</i>"

answers: [
  "Statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not sufficient.",
  "Statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not sufficient.",
  "BOTH statements TOGETHER are sufficient, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient.",
  "EACH statement ALONE is sufficient.",
  "Statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient."
]

explanation: "Yes or No: Is the value of <i>w</i> less than the value of <i>y</i>? The statements are a little more annoying.(1) INSUFFICIENT: This statement provides a range of possible values for <i>w</i>, but gives no information about <i>y</i>, so it's impossible to say whether <i>w</i> is less than <i>y</i>.(2) INSUFFICIENT: This statement provides a range of possible values for <i>y</i>, but gives no information about <i>w</i>, so it's impossible to say whether <i>w</i> is less than <i>y</i>.(1) AND (2) INSUFFICIENT: The second inequality has the sign in the reverse order, so switch it around in order to compare the two:<br>1.3 &lt; <i>w</i> &lt; 1.3101<br><i>y</i> &gt; 1.3033<br>If it's helpful to you, sketch out a number line to help visualize the information. The start of the range of possible values for <i>y</i>, 1.3033, starts in between 1.3 and 1.3101, and then continues to extend forever to the rightâ€”that is, to values greater than 1.3101. <br>Case 1: <i>w</i> = 1.301 and <i>y</i> = 1.305. In this case, Yes, <i>w</i> is less than <i>y</i>. <br>Case 2: <i>w</i> = 1.31 and <i>y</i> = 1.305. In this case No, <i>w</i> is not less than <i>y</i>.<br>Since there are both Yes and No answers to this question, (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.The correct answer is (E): Even when used together, the two statements are not sufficient to answer the question."
