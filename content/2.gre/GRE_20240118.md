  'validation',
  'vainglory',
  'apotheosis',

  'beneficence'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The clues in the sentence indicate that Michalewski's text is \"indubitably\" (or \"unquestionably\") impressive and important; in fact, it's \"unmatched.\" <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Given all of the praise in the sentence, the correct answer will be an extremely positive word, something that describes the book as the \"acme\" or \"epitome\" or \"high point\" of the profession. <strong>Select the best match from among the choices</strong> A scan of the answer choices reveals that almost every one carries a positive charge. The only one with a negative charge is (B) <i>vainglory</i>, which means \"excessive or unjustified pride,\" and it can be eliminated. Of the positive words, <strong>(C)</strong><i>apotheosis</i>, the \"ideal example,\" fits the prediction. (A) <i>validation</i>, which means \"approval\" or \"authorization,\" isn't strongly positive enough. This person's text doesn't just <i>confirm the worth </i>of the profession; rather it is <i>a shining example</i><i>. </i>(D) <i>munificence</i> and (E) <i>beneficence</i> both mean \"generosity\"; not only do they not fit the context of the sentence, but they can also be eliminated because they can't both be the answer. <strong>Confirm your answer by reading it into the sentence</strong> Michalewski's text indubitably serves as the <i>apotheosis</i> of his discipline; surpassing all previous models of excellence, it has replaced them with the rigor of heretofore unmatched academic standards. TAKEAWAY: Remember that synonyms in the answer choices for the same blank can be eliminated."
