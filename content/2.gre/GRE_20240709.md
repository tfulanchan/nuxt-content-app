question: " The family abjured store-bought cards, deeming the cloying quips to be too _______ to express proper sentiment in a tasteful manner."

answers: [
  'rancorous',
  'brusque',
  'candid',
  'mawkish',
  'sanguine'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> According to this sentence, the family \"abjured\" (or avoided) \"store bought cards\", because they wanted to express the \"proper sentiment in a tasteful manner,\" which pre-made cards were too \"cloying,\" or overly sweet, to do. If you weren't familiar with \"abjure\", you can still infer that they felt negatively about them, since they don't express \"proper sentiment.\" <strong>Predict an answer</strong> The right answer will be an adjective that describes these cards, and since all that's known is that they're overly sweet, it will be in line with that meaning. <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> The clues lead to <strong>(D) </strong><i>mawkish</i>, meaning \"overly sentimental\" as the correct answer. (A) <i>rancorous</i> would refer to bitter sentiments, and (B) <i>brusque</i> means \"gruff\" or \"blunt\"; while both would make the cards undesirable, they don't describe \"cloying\" cards. (C) <i>candid,</i> meaning \"honest,\" would describe appropriately expressed sentiment, not inappropriately expressed sentiment, so it is also incorrect. Finally, (E) <i>sanguine</i>, meaning \"confident\" or \"optimistic,\" is, like <i>candid</i>, too positive to match the prediction. <strong>Check your answer</strong> The family abjured store-bought cards, deeming the cloying quips to be too <i>mawkish</i> to express proper sentiment in a tasteful manner. TAKEAWAY: If there's an unfamiliar vocabulary word in the sentence itself, use other clues in the sentence to figure out what the blank means."
