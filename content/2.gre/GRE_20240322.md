question: " By approximately what percentage did the average GPA at High School <i>X</i> increase from 2012 to 2016 ?"

answers: [
  '5%',
  '20%',
  '38%',
  '50%',
  '64%'
]

explanation: "Approach strategically To determine a percent increase, use the percent change formula: % change = ( amount of change original value ) ( 100 % ) . According to the graph, the amount of change from 2012 to 2016 is about (3.85 - 3.2) = 0.65, and the original value (in 2012) is 3.2. Substituting these values into the formula yields % change = ( 0 . 65 3 . 2 ) ( 100 % ) â‰ˆ 20 % . This value matches (B) , which is the correct answer. TAKEAWAY: Be sure you know the percent change formula and how to apply it to word problems. <strong>Analyze the graphs</strong> This pie chart shows the distribution of students across different math classes. Only one percentage is given: 20% of the students are taking algebra. The other proportions are given in terms of the variable <i>p</i> or <i>n</i>. The total number of students is not given, nor is any number of students in any of the classes given. The line graph presents the average GPA at the same school for each of five consecutive years."
