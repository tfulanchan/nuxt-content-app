question: " What percent of the total 2014 income from farm <i>X</i> was the income from both livestock and lettuce?"

answers: [
  '41.2%',
  '49.75%',
  '52%',
  '55%',
  '60.8%'
]

explanation: "Approach strategically The percent of the income from livestock can be determined from the first pie chart, which gives the distribution of income among vegetables, fruit, and livestock. The percent of income from livestock was 37%. To find the percent of the income from lettuce, you need to use both pie charts. From the second pie chart, you know that 15% of the income from vegetables was from lettuce, and from the first pie chart, you know that 28% of the farm's total income was from vegetables. Thus, the income from lettuce was 15% of 28% of the farm's total income, which is 0.15 x 0.28 = 0.042, or 4.2%. Therefore, the percentage of farm X's total income derived from livestock and lettuce combined was 37% + 4.2% = 41.2%. (A) is correct TAKEAWAY: Some graphs represent percentages of another percentage. To find a value that is a percentage of a percentage of a whole, multiply the percents by each other and then by the whole. <strong>Analyze the graphs</strong> The first pie chart shows the percentages of farm X's income for 2014 derived from livestock, fruit, and vegetables. The second pie chart shows the percentages of just the farm's income from vegetables derived from five different vegetables. Neither graph provides an amount of income; only percentages are given."
