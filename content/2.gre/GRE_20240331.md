question: " By using setbacks and converging lines, the architect cleverly _______ the building's apparent height to make it seem larger."

answers: [
  'beautified',
  'diminished',
  'attenuated',
  'abridged',
  'enhanced'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> Although the first part of the sentence does use some technical architecture terms, there's no need to know what they mean to answer this question. According to the second clause, the architect cleverly used these techniques to make it seem taller than it really was. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> The blank describes what the architect did to the apparent height, so it will be something like <i>increased</i> or <i>exaggerated</i>. <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>Check your answer</strong> The correct answer is<strong> (E) </strong><i>enhanced</i>, which means \"heightened\" or \"increased.\" While (A) <i>beautified</i> may be something an architect does to a building, it doesn't fit this specific context of making the building seem taller. (B) <i>diminished </i>is the opposite of the effect wanted here. <strong>(C) </strong><i>attenuated</i> means \"to lessen\" or \"to reduce\"; if the apparent height was <i>attenuated</i>, then it would seem shorter than it was. (D) <i>abridged</i>, means \"shorten by leaving out or removing\"; not only is this the opposite effect of what was predicted, but it is used almost exclusively to refer to text rather than physical dimensions. TAKEAWAY: Don't worry if you see technical jargon in a short verbal question; the sentence will have to provide enough other clues to determine the meaning of the blank."
