question: " Although the novelist attempted a masterful expression of human emotion, his writing was in fact _______; his grandiose demeanor distracted many from a body of work lacking both depth and aesthetic appeal."

answers: [
  'trenchant',
  'prosaic',
  'distinct',
  'vapid',
  'unequivocal',
  'ardent'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The detour road sign \"Although\" and the context clues \"attempted\" and \"in fact\" indicate that the poet's writing is in fact the opposite of \"a masterful expression\" and is actually \"lacking both depth and aesthetic appeal.\" <strong>Predict an answer</strong> From this, predict that the correct answers will have a meaning related to \"bad writing,\" such as \"dull\" or \"shallow.\" <strong>Select the two choices that most closely match your prediction</strong> <strong>(B) </strong><i>prosaic</i> and <strong>(D) </strong><i>vapid</i> both mean \"uncreative,\" \"uninteresting,\" or \"bland\" and are correct. (A) <i>trenchant</i>, meaning \"incisive,\" and (F) <i>ardent</i>, meaning \"passionate,\" are the opposite of the prediction; eliminate. (C) <i>distinct</i> and (E) <i>unequivocal</i> both suggest that the writing was unique or exceptionally clear, respectively, but the context indicates that quite the opposite was the case. <strong>Check your answers to see if the sentence retains the same meaning</strong> Read back into the sentence, <strong>(B)</strong> and <strong>(D)</strong> give it the same meaning and make sense. They are correct. TAKEAWAY: Be alert to detour road signs that tell you the words for the blank are in contrast to other words in the sentence."
