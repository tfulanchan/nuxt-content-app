question: "Inured to the intense work engendered by the deadlines they normally faced, the production managers felt somewhat _______ by the temporary hiatus in orders."

answers: [
  'constrained',
  'disoriented',
  'wizened',
  'overworked',
  'dehumanized'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> According to the sentence, the production managers are \"inured\" (or \"accustomed\") to deadline pressure, and the blank describes their reaction to a \"hiatus\" (or \"break\") in orders. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Given the previous intense work, a temporary halt in orders would be unexpected. <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(B) </strong><i>disoriented</i> means \"lost\" or \"confused\", and it is the right answer choice. With time on their hands they wouldn't feel (A) <i>constrained</i> (\"restricted\") or (E) <i>dehumanized</i> (\"lacking human qualities\"). The managers might feel underworked, but they certainly wouldn't feel (D) <i>overworked</i> during a hiatus. (C) <i>wizened</i> means \"dried up\" or \"withered,\" which doesn't make any sense in the sentence. <strong>Check your answer</strong> Inured to the intense work engendered by the deadlines they normally faced, the production managers felt somewhat <i>disoriented</i> by the temporary hiatus in orders. TAKEAWAY: Understanding the vocabulary in the original sentence is just as important as understanding the vocabulary in the answer choices."
