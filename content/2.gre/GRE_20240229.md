question: " If the total income of farm <i>X</i> in 2014 was <i>t</i> dollars, and the average (arithmetic mean) of the incomes from corn, lettuce, and tomatoes at farm <i>X</i> in 2014 was <i>v</i> dollars, then which of the following equations correctly gives <i>v</i> in terms of <i>t</i> ?"

answers: [
  'v= 0.03t',
  'v= 0.056t',
  'v= 0.07t',
  'v= 0.168t',
  'v= 0.2t'
]

explanation: "Approach strategically Since the total income from farm X was t dollars, and the first pie chart indicates that the income from vegetables was 28% of the farm's total income, you can represent this as 0.28t dollars (remember that of means multiply ). From the second pie chart, you know that 20% of the income from vegetables was from corn, 15% of the income from vegetables was from lettuce, and 25% of the income from vegetables was from tomatoes. So the percentage of the vegetable income that was from corn, lettuce, and tomatoes was 20% + 15% + 25% = 60%. Since the income from vegetables was 0.28t dollars, the sum of the incomes from corn, lettuce, and tomatoes was 60% of (0.28t ) dollars, or (0.6)(0.28t ) dollars, which equals 0.168t dollars. The average formula is Average = Sum of the terms Number of terms , so the average of the incomes from corn, lettuce, and tomatoes at farm X was 0.168 t dollars 3 = 0.056 t dollars . Since this average represents v dollars, v = 0.056t, which is (B) . TAKEAWAY: When translating information into algebra, working step-by-step can make even a tough problem manageable. <strong>Analyze the graphs</strong> The first pie chart shows the percentages of farm X's income for 2014 derived from livestock, fruit, and vegetables. The second pie chart shows the percentages of just the farm's income from vegetables derived from five different vegetables. Neither graph provides an amount of income; only percentages are given."
