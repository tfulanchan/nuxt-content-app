question: "Even rigidly traditional instructors are finding the new method difficult to _______; its implementation reinforces basics while preparing trainees for more difficult tasks with considerable efficiency."

answers: [
  'endorse',
  'hinder',
  'fault',
  'engender',
  'propose'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The sentence talks about the benefits of a new method of training, and the blank is connected to the reaction of instructors who \"rigidly traditional.\" A traditional instructor would be likely to resist new methods, but \"even\" indicates that they must be warming up to it. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Predict even traditional instructors are finding it difficult to \"criticize.\" <strong>Select the best match from among the choices</strong> <strong>(C)</strong> <i>fault</i> fits the prediction because it is a synonym for criticize. (A) <i>endorse</i> means \"support\"; while they do support the idea, the blank follows \"difficult to\", so it must be the opposite of their feelings. (D) <i>engender</i>, or \"develop\", is similarly too positive. (B) <i>hinder</i>, or \"slow down\" is incorrect because \"difficult to hinder\" doesn't convey the idea that they're in favor of it. (E) <i>propose</i> doesn't make sense; the new method already exists, so the traditional instructors wouldn't be trying to <i>propose</i> it. <strong>Confirm your answer by reading it into the sentence</strong> Even rigidly traditional instructors are finding the new method difficult to <i>fault</i>; its implementation reinforces basics while preparing trainees for more difficult tasks with considerable efficiency. TAKEAWAY: A construction like \"difficult to _______\" means that the word in the blank is the opposite of the actual opinion."
