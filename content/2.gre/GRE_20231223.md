question: " The gray-green foliage of the eucalyptus provides the soft, spatially deceptive background color of the Australian bush, monotonous at first but rippling with _____ to the acclimatized eye."

answers: [
  'nuance',
  'intrigue',
  'vegetation',
  'zephyrs',
  'gesticulation'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> In this sentence, the detour roadsign \"but\" indicates contrast with \"monotonous,\" which means \"uniform\" or \"unvarying.\" A further clue is that the acclimatized eye sees the background as \"rippling\" with whatever the missing word describes. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> A good prediction would be \"detailed variety\" The background seems uniform or unvarying at first, but is \"rippling\" with detailed variety to someone who has looked at it for some time. <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(A)</strong> <i>nuance</i>, or \"subtle variety\" is a good match for the prediction, and is the correct answer. (B) <i>intrigue</i> used as a noun here means \"secret scheme,\" which doesn't make sense in this sentence. This choice may have been tempting because as a verb, intrigued can mean \"arouse curiosity, interest.\" Someone might be intrigued by the Australian bush, but it doesn't make sense to say the bush was rippling with intrigue. (D) <i>zephyrs</i> are a type of wind or breeze, which doesn't contrast with \"monotonous.\" (E) <i>gesticulation</i> is abrupt movement, which doesn't make sense as a contrast to \"monotonous.\" <strong>Check your answer</strong> The gray-green foliage of the eucalyptus provides the soft, spatially deceptive background color of the Australian bush, monotonous at first but rippling with <i>nuance</i> to the acclimatized eye. TAKEAWAY: Watch out for words that have different meanings when used in different ways."
