question: " The great discovery of the turn-of-the-century period was that a work of art can be virtually divorced from representation of the physical world; it can convey sensations of, or feelings about, life without requiring _______."

answers: [
  'extemporaneousness',
  'harmony',
  'permanence',
  'independence',
  'verisimilitude'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The phrase \"divorced from\" is a detour roadsign indicating a contrast. The art under discussion does not necessarily represent the physical world; it may be abstract or otherwise not conventionally realistic. The second half of the sentence continues this idea, and the word \"without\" signals that the word in the blank is a quality this less realistic art does <i>not</i> have. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Predict something like \"realism\" or \"similarity to the real world.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(E)</strong> <i>verisimilitude</i> means \"giving the impression of reality or truth\" (the root <i>ver</i> means \"truth,\" as in <i>verify</i>, and the root <i>sim</i> means \"same, like\" as in \"<i>simulation</i>\"). This word is a match for the prediction. (A) <i>extemporaneousness</i> means \"without prior thought or planning.\" It is possible for a work of art to lack <i>extemporaneousness</i>, but this has no bearing on whether it represents the physical world. Neither this word nor (B) <i>harmony</i>, (C) <i>permanence</i>, or (D) <i>independence</i> relate to the clues about what quality this particular art does not have, and all are incorrect. <strong>Check your answer</strong> The great discovery of the turn-of-the-century period was that a work of art can be virtually divorced from representation of the physical world; it can convey sensations of, or feelings about, life without requiring <i>verisimilitude</i>. TAKEAWAY: Taking a word apart to look at its roots often reveals at least approximately what it means."
