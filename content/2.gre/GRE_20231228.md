question: " The barred shadows on the actor's otherwise brightly lit face, cast by Venetian blinds, created an effect _______ film noir, a style of filmmaking marked by high-contrast visuals."

answers: [
  'antithetical to',
  'emblematic of',
  'incompatible with',
  'boycotted by',
  'dramatized by'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> There are \"barred shadows\" on an actor's \"brightly lit\" face, and the blank describes the relationship of this effect to film noir, which has \"high-contrast visuals.\" <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Since light and shadows are themselves a contrast, a good prediction might be \"similar to.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(B)</strong> <i>emblematic of</i>, or \"representative of,\" is the correct answer. (A) <i>antithetical to</i>, or \"in direct opposition to,\" and (C) <i>incompatible with</i>, are the opposite of this prediction and so can be eliminated. If you weren't familiar with <i>antithetical</i>, the prefix <i>anti- </i>is a strong hint that it's a negative word that means something like \"opposes.\" (D)<i> boycotted</i> is incorrect because a <i>boycott</i> is an organized refusal to conduct business with a particular group. (E) <i>dramatized</i> might be tempting because the word <i>drama</i> is associated with actors and filmmaking. However, to <i>dramatize</i> means to present or adapt something in a theatrical manner; contrast is a technique used in film noir, not something that movies in this genre are fictionalizing. <strong>Check your answer</strong> The barred shadows on the actor's otherwise brightly lit face, cast by Venetian blinds, created an effect <i>emblematic of</i> film noir, a style of filmmaking marked by high-contrast visuals. TAKEAWAY: Prefixes can help you figure out the general meaning of unfamiliar words."
