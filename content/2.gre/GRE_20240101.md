question: " The filmmaker's innovation is commendable; while other, more banal directors would create suspense with _______ cinematic devices, he relies only on his actors for the film's emotional power."

answers: [
  'terrifying',
  'fresh',
  'spectacular',
  'clever',
  'hackneyed'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The sentence suggests that this director is innovative while others are \"banal,\" which is just the opposite: unoriginal. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Since the blank describes techniques used by these banal directors, the right answer will mean something negative like \"unoriginal\" or \"cliched.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(E) </strong><i>hackneyed</i>, which means \"very familiar through overuse,\" is correct. Even though cinematic devices could be (B) <i>fresh</i>, (C) <i>spectacular</i>, or (D) <i>clever</i>, these kinds of devices wouldn't be used by unoriginal directors, so they must be incorrect. These words could describe the approach taken by the \"innovative\" filmmaker. And while (A) <i>terrifying</i> has a negative connotation, but is not in direct contrast to \"innovation.\" <strong>Check your answer</strong> The filmmaker's innovation is commendable; while other, more banal directors would create suspense with <i>hackneyed</i> cinematic devices, he relies only on his actors for the film's emotional power. TAKEAWAY: Watch out for words that fit the general subject matter of the sentence but that don't fit the specific clues."
