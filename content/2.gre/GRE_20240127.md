  'effective'

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The first roadsign in this sentence is the conjunction \"while,\" which means that there will be a contrast between the clauses in the second part of the sentence; this is reinforced by the fact that the first clause says art restoration is a controversial field. The first blank describes what art restorers do to damage in famous works; \"restoration\" means that they'll fix it. Since the rest of the sentence says that some people question the use of these techniques, the second blank must show that some people are in favor of them. <strong>Predict the answer</strong> The first blank will be something like \"fix,\" and the second will be something positive, like \"commendable.\" <strong>Select the answer choices that most closely match your predictions</strong> <strong>(A) </strong><i>mitigate</i> (\"to lessen the effect of\") matches the predicted meaning of slowing the damage to art; it's the first correct answer. (B) <i>nullify</i> (\"cancel out\") and (C) <i>prevent</i> may both be tempting, but according to the sentence, the damage is \"inevitable,\" meaning that it cannot be completely canceled or prevented. <strong>(E) </strong><i>laudable</i> means \"worthy of praise\" and matches the prediction. (D) <i>moot</i> (\"no longer relevant\") does not fit with the description of this field as \"controversial.\" Nothing is said about how effective the techniques are, so reject (F) <i>effective</i>. <strong>Check your answer</strong> Art restoration is a controversial field; while its efforts to <i>mitigate</i> the inevitable damage done by time to famous works are considered <i>laudable</i>, some people question the field's use of invasive techniques on some of history's greatest masterpieces.<br> TAKEAWAY: Beware of choices that are too extreme for the clues in the sentence."
