  'success',
  'renown',
  'results',
  'accolades',
  'alacrity',
  'swiftness'

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> In this sentence, the conjunction \"and\" links two positive attributes of the trip, the first of which is that the trip was accomplished with \"very little incident.\" The second attribute must also reflect a positive attribute of the trip that might have been a surprise, \"considering\" that the trip was long and the terrain difficult. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Since the answer is something that might not be expected for a long trip over difficult terrain, predict something like \"ease or speed.\" <strong>Select the two choices that most closely match your prediction</strong> <strong>(E)</strong> <i>alacrity</i> means \"speed\" in this context and is therefore similar to <strong>(F)</strong><i>swiftness</i>. These fit the prediction well and are the correct answers. (A) <i>success</i> and (C) <i>results</i> are positive but too general. They don't specifically relate to difficult terrain and long distance. (B) <i>renown</i> and (D) <i>accolades</i> both suggest praise or acclaim. Perhaps such a journey would receive praise after it is completed, but the sentence is only discussing the journey itself and how \"the journey was completed.\" It is saying that even though there was difficult terrain and long distances, the journey was completed with no incidents and with something else. Neither (B) nor (D) relates to how the journey was completed. <strong>Check your answers to see if the sentence retains the same meaning</strong> Considering the difficulty of the terrain and the great distance over which the expedition traveled, the journey was completed with very little incident and with noteworthy <i>alacrity/swiftness</i>. TAKEAWAY: The correct answer choices not only have to yield complete sentences that are similar in meaning, but also have to fit the meaning of the sentence as a whole."
