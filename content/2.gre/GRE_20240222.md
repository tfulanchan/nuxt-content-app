  'delineated',
  'reviled',
  'falsified',
  'ridiculed',
  'belied'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> On one side of this blank are the keywords \"calm exterior\" and on the other \"militant fervor.\" Since there's no detour roadsign to indicate this contrast, the right answer must provide it. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> The right answer will be a word that means something like \"contradicts.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(E) </strong><i>belied </i>means \"gave a false impression of,\" and it's the right answer. A calm exterior wouldn't (A) <i>delineate</i>, meaning \"indicate\" or \"portray in detail,\" militant fervor. (B) <i>reviled </i>means \"hated and despised,\" which is not something a \"calm exterior\" would do to military fervor. (C) <i>falsified </i>might be tempting, because a calm exterior could give a false impression about the militant fervor underneath, but a calm exterior would not make the fervor false, which is what <i>falsify </i>means. (D) <i>ridiculed</i>, or \"mocked\" also doesn't indicate a contrast. <strong>Check your answer</strong> His calm exterior <i>belied</i> the militant fervor with which he threw himself into the campaign. TAKEAWAY: Sometimes, the blank itself will be a missing roadsign."
