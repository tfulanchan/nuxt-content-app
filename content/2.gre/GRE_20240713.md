question: " Which of the following ratios is closest to the ratio of the sales of brand <i>A</i> clothing in the January-to-February interval to the sales of brand <i>A</i> clothing in the September-October interval?"

answers: [
  '5 to 6',
  '7 to 8',
  '8 to 7',
  '6 to 5',
  '4 to 1'
]

explanation: "Approach strategically You might be tempted to consult the bar graph first to find the value of brand A's sales; however, this is unnecessary. Since the question asks only for the ratio between brand A's sales over two different two-month intervals, it's only necessary to compare the percentages in the pie chart to determine the ratio. The January-February interval represents 16% of brand A's total sales, and the September-October interval represents 14%, so the ratio between these two intervals is 16:14, which reduces to 8:7, making (C) correct. Before careful to calculate the ratio of sales in January/February to those in September/October and not the other way around; choice (B) lies in wait for the careless. TAKEAWAY: Since all percentages are a part-to-whole ratio with the same value, 100, as the whole, you can compare two or more percentages of the same item to directly calculate the ratio between those amounts. <strong>Analyze the graphs</strong> Two graphs are presented: a bar graph that shows the sales numbers for five different brands of clothing by a store in the year 2015, and a pie chart that shows the percentages of brand <i>A</i>'s total sales for six 2-month periods over the same year."
