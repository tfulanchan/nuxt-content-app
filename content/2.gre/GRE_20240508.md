question: " What was the ratio of the income of farm <i>X</i> from fruit to the income of farm <i>X</i> from vegetables in 2014 ?"

answers: [
  '3 to 4',
  '4 to 5',
  '5 to 4',
  '4 to 3',
  '18 to 5'
]

explanation: "Approach strategically The question is seeking a ratio of one kind of income to another. Find the proportions of the farm's income from fruit and vegetables in the first pie chart. The amount of income is not provided, but it's not necessary since you're being asked for a ratio and not an amount. One way to state a ratio is as a fraction. This is usually the most convenient way since you can perform arithmetic operations on a fraction. Here, the ratio is this: fruit vegetables = 35 % 28 % = 5 4 (C) states this ratio in a different format. TAKEAWAY: Remember that percents of the same whole are ratios with the same number, 100, as the denominator. Thus, the numerators-the percents-can be directly compared to arrive at a ratio. <strong>Analyze the graphs</strong> The first pie chart shows the percentages of farm X's income for 2014 derived from livestock, fruit, and vegetables. The second pie chart shows the percentages of just the farm's income from vegetables derived from five different vegetables. Neither graph provides an amount of income; only percentages are given."
