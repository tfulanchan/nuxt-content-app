question: " Although the penal colony of Sydney lay on the edge of a vast and isolated continent, convicts suffered from the _______ that they could walk to China in a few days; they escaped only to perish in the merciless Australian interior."

answers: [
  'anomaly',
  'conclusion',
  'misapprehension',
  'aberration',
  'anxiety'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The detour roadsign <i>although</i> is a clue that there is a contrast. The convicts thought that they could walk to China in just a few days, which was a huge misconception, since Australia is a \"vast and isolated continent\". <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Look for a word that means \"misconception\" or \"misunderstanding.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> The only choice that fits this definition is <strong>(C)</strong><i>misapprehension</i>, or \"mistaken belief\". (A) <i>anomaly</i> means \"something out of the ordinary,\" but there's no way to know if this belief was out of the ordinary. (D) <i>aberration</i> has a similar meaning of \"deviation from the expected,\" so it's also incorrect. (B) c<i>onclusion</i> would, in this context, mean \"reasoned judgment\"; however, such a judgment could be right or wrong, so it doesn't fit. (E) <i>anxiety</i> means \"uneasiness\"; the prisoners might be uneasy about being imprisoned, but it doesn't describe their misconception about China. <strong>Check your answer</strong>"
