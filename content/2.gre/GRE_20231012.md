question: "Because she was still weak from the effects of anesthesia two days before, the politician's public update on her health showed _______ she never showed during her fervent campaign."

answers: [
  'a clemency',
  'an obstinacy',
  'a reticence',
  'a lassitude',
  'a verbosity'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The straight-ahead roadsign \"because\" is an indication that the politician's behavior will be due to the anesthesia. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Look for a word like \"sleepiness\" or \"weakness\" - something that might be the effect of anesthesia. <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> The only choice that works is <strong>(D)</strong><i>a lassitude</i>, or \"weariness.\" (A) <i>a clemency</i> means \"mercy.\" (B) <i>an obstinacy</i> means \"stubbornness.\" (C) <i>a reticence</i> means \"hesitation\" and (E) <i>a verbosity </i>means \"excessive wordiness.\" None of these fit the prediction of something that could be caused by anesthesia, so they're incorrect. <strong>Check your answer</strong>"
