question: " The girl's composure was astounding given her youthfulness; _______ and self-possessed, she clearly had no predilection for confusing exhilaration with contentment."

answers: [
  'nonplussed',
  'reserved',
  'contrite',
  'decorous',
  'lethargic',
  'apathetic'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The semicolon serves as a straight-ahead roadsign, indicating that the second clause clarifies (rather than contrasts with) the first clause. Therefore, like \"self-possessed,\" the missing word would describe someone who demonstrated composure. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> The correct answers will mean something like \"poised,\" \"self-assured,\" \"calm,\" or \"collected.\" All of these, as well as others, would be consistent with self-possession and composure. <strong>Select the two choices that most closely match your prediction</strong> <strong>(B)</strong> <i>reserved, </i>meaning \"restrained in words and actions,\" and <strong>(D)</strong> <i>decorous</i>, meaning \"proper, tasteful,\" are consistent with self-possession and composure. Although these words may veer more toward the topic of etiquette than was expected, no other two choices are consistent with the prediction, so these two are correct. (A) <i>nonplussed</i> means \"bewildered\" and (C) <i>contrite</i> means \"remorseful.\" Neither is supported by the context, so both are incorrect. (E) <i>lethargic</i> and (F) <i>apathetic</i> indicate a lack of excitement (as suggested in the second clause), but are incorrect because they introduce new qualities of indifference and boredom that distort the positive description of \"contentment.\" <strong>Check your answers to see if the sentence retains the same meaning</strong> The girl's composure was astounding given her youthfulness; <i>reserved/decorous</i> and self-possessed, she clearly had no predilection for confusing exhilaration with contentment. TAKEAWAY: Even if you can't find a close match for your prediction, look for a set of words that are at least consistent with your prediction, that fit the meaning of the sentence as a whole, and that yield complete sentences that are similar in meaning."
