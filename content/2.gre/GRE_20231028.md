question: "Despite their strong resemblance to winsome, cuddly teddy bears, the koalas of eastern Australia are remarkably _______ in character."

answers: [
  'pungent',
  'charming',
  'insouciant',
  'irritable',
  'sluggish'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The detour roadsign \"despite\" indicates that there is a contrast. If teddy bears are winsome (or \"having a good disposition\"), cuddly creatures, then koalas must be the opposite of that. Even without knowing the meaning of \"winsome,\" you can use the word \"cuddly\" as a clue to the positive nature of teddy bears. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Try a negative word, like \"nasty\" or \"prickly.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(D)</strong><i> Irritable</i>, or \"easily annoyed,\" works well as the opposite of \"winsome\" and is the correct answer. (A) <i>pungent</i>, which means \"having a strong odor,\" may be negative, but it does not contrast with \"winsome\" or \"cuddly.\"<i></i>(B)<i> c</i><i>harming</i> is positive; it would describe something that is similar in disposition to teddy bears. (C) <i>insouciant</i> means \"having lighthearted unconcern,\" which does not speak to the implied unpleasant personality of koalas. (E) s<i>luggish</i> means \"slow\" or \"lethargic\"; although koalas do move slowly, the sentence is not speaking to this quality of either koalas or teddy bears. <strong>Check your answer</strong>"
