answers: [
  'quaffs',
  'preserves',
  'taunts',
  'condones',
  'immures'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The main clues here are that Montresor is \"vengeful\" and that he sealed his friend inside a wall. <strong>Predict an answer</strong> The right answer will be a verb that describes what Montresor did to this unlucky friend of his; it'll be something like \"trapped.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> (E) <i>immures</i>, or \"encloses within walls\" is the correct answer. Even without knowing that specific meaning, you might be able to make an educated guess, because the root, \"mur,\" comes from the Latin for \"wall\", as in <i>murals</i>, or paintings made on walls. (A) <i>quaffs</i> means \"drinks.\" (B) <i>preserves</i>, which means \"keeps safe\" or \"protects\" is an unlikely result of being sealed inside of a wall. (C)<i> taunts</i>, or \"insults\" is too mild to match the clues. (D) <i>condones</i> means \"approves of wrongdoing\"; someone else might <i>condone</i> Fortunato being trapped inside of a wall, but since Montresor himself trapped his friend in the wall, he's not <i>condoning</i> his own actions. <strong>Check your answer</strong> In Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Cask of Amontillado,\" the vengeful Montresor <i>immures</i> his friend Fortunato by sealing him up inside a wall. TAKEAWAY: If you're not familiar with the meaning of a word, see if you can identify its root to figure out what it means."
