question: " Many stories about George Washington have been passed down through the generations, but a significant number of them lack the ring of truth and are _______."

answers: [
  'anachronistic',
  'illogical',
  'unabridged',
  'apocryphal',
  'authentic'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> In this sentence, the blank needs to accord with the idea that the stories about Washington \"lack the ring of truth.\" <strong>Predict an answer</strong> The right answer will mean something like \"false.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(D) </strong><i>apocryphal</i> means \"of doubtful authenticity,\" which fits the prediction perfectly. (A) <i>anachronistic </i>means \"occurring out of its proper time\"; while this could be a reason that a story is false, there's no support for this specificity. (B) <i>illogical </i>means \"against reason\"; however, just because something is unreasonable doesn't mean it's incorrect. (C) <i>unabridged </i>means \"complete, uncut,\" which doesn't say anything about falsity. (E) <i>authentic </i>means \"true or real,\" which is the opposite of what's needed. <strong>Check your answer</strong> Many stories about George Washington have been passed down through the generations, but a significant number of them lack the ring of truth and are <i>apocryphal</i>. TAKEAWAY: Make sure the answer you pick matches the level of specificity in the sentence; if it's too specific, there may not be support for it."
