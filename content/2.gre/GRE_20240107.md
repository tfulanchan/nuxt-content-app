question: " While they were aware that their daughter's novel interest in performance arts might not develop into a career, the parents did everything they could to encourage their child's _______ passion for music, including buying her a piano."

answers: [
  'tentative',
  'nascent',
  'faltering',
  'juvenile',
  'prescient'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The daughter's \"interest in performance arts\" is described as \"novel,\" and the blank describes her \"passion for music.\" <strong>Predict an answer</strong> Since music is a performance art, the missing word will mean something similar to \"new.\" <strong>Select the choice that most closely matches your prediction</strong> <strong>(B)</strong> <i>nascent</i> means \"emerging,\" which fits the prediction and is correct. (A) <i>tentative</i>, which means \"hesitant\" or \"not confirmed\" is unsupported by the context; there is nothing in the sentence to suggest that the daughter is \"hesitant\" about her newfound love of music. (C) <i>faltering</i>, or \"unsteady,\" is incorrect for the same reason as (A). (D) <i>juvenile</i>, meaning \"youthful\" or \"immature,\" carries a slightly negative connotation that does not fit the context. (E) <i>prescient</i>, or \"having foreknowledge,ï¿½ is unsupported by any details in the sentence. <strong>Check your answer</strong> While they were aware that their daughter's novel interest in performance arts might not develop into a career, the parents did everything they could to encourage their child's <i>nascent</i> passion for music, including buying her a piano.<br> TAKEAWAY: Don't pick a negative word when there's no support for it."
