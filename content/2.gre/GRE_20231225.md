question: " The _______ of the students during the principal's speech enraged and disheartened the new teacher, and she was distraught at her inability to take control of a group that appeared to have such a blatant disrespect for authority."

answers: [
  'contrition',
  'apathy',
  'flippancy',
  'simplicity',
  'impertinence',
  'indolence'
]

explanation: "<strong>Read the sentence, looking for clues</strong> The entire sentence defines the missing word, which describes the behavior of the students. This behavior upset the new teacher, and she was unable to control the students, who displayed \"blatant disrespect for authority.\" <strong>Predict an answer</strong> A good prediction for the blank would simply be \"disrespect.\" <strong>Select the two choices that most closely match your prediction</strong> <strong>(C) </strong><i>flippancy</i>, meaning \"inappropriate levity,\" and <strong>(E) </strong><i>impertinence</i>, meaning \"disrespect\" or \"impudence,\" match this prediction and are correct. (A)<strong></strong><i>contrition</i> means \"remorse\"; while it's possible that some students felt remorse about their actions later, the blank is about their behavior during the speech. (D) <i>simplicity</i> means \"uncomplicated,\" which doesn't match the prediction. (B)<strong></strong><i>apathy</i> and (F) <i>indolence</i> mean \"indifference\" and \"laziness,\" respectively; these are both examples of bad behavior on the part of students, but the clues in the sentence point to the idea of \"blatant disrespect,\" not laziness or indifference. For these reasons, (B) and (F) are incorrect. <strong>Check your answers to see if the sentence retains the same meaning</strong> The <i>flippancy/impertinence</i> of the students during the principal's speech enraged and disheartened the new teacher, and she was distraught at her inability to take control of a group that appeared to have such a blatant disrespect for authority. TAKEAWAY: Sometimes, it's not enough to simply predict that the blank will be a negative word; the right answer has to fit the specific clues given."
